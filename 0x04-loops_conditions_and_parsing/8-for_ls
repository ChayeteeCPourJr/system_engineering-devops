#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script displays the content of the current directory,
# showing only the part of the name after the first dash, one item per line.

# Iterate through each file and directory in the current directory.
# The 'ls' command without '-a' or '-A' options will not display hidden files.
for item in *; do
  # Check if the item is a file or directory that is not hidden.
  # This check helps to avoid issues if there are no non-hidden files,
  # as '*' might expand to the literal '*' if no matches are found,
  # or to handle cases where the glob might pick up something unexpected.
  # However, the primary requirement is to not display hidden files,
  # which 'for item in *' already handles.
  # The example output suggests that directories should also be processed.

  # Extract the part of the name after the first dash.
  # "${item#*-}" removes the shortest match of '*-' from the beginning of the string.
  # If there is no dash, the entire filename will be displayed.
  # This matches the example behavior where 'fizzbuzz' is displayed as 'fizzbuzz'.
  echo "${item#*-}"
